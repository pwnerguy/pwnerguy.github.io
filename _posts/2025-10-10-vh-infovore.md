# Introduction
-------------

This writeup documents the penetration testing of the [**infovore: 1**](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/infovore-1,496/) machine. This machine has been downloaded from the [**VulnHub**](https://vulnhub.com) platform.  In this ocasion I'll exploit some php functions and lazy sys admins' configurations as the description says.

<br>
# Information Gathering
----------------

Firstly, we need to discover the IP of the **infovore** machine. We will use **arp-scan**.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/arp-scan.png)

I use the **settarget** function to set the target IP in the Polybar, so that we can see in any moment DarkHole's IP.

After identifying the target's IP address, we need to enumerate as  much information as possible about the host.

A quick way to get a hint of the OS is checking the TTL value from a simple ping to a host on our local network. The [**whichSystem**](https://github.com/Akronox/WichSystem.py) script can also be used for this purpose.
* TTL 64: Linux.
* TTL 128: Windows.

In this case it appears to be a Linux machine. Now we will perform a port scan.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/nmap1.png)

**extractPorts** reads the grepable export file allPorts, shows me the open ports and copy them in the clipboard. 

Let's perform a deeper scan using basic recon nmap scripts to see more information about the port 80.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/nmap2.png)

After performing this second scan we can see that we are facing an Apache web server running on a Debian machine. We can also see a title **"Include me ..."**.

Let's figure out the Debian version codename. We need to search in the internet the Apache version followed by '**launchpad**'.

We are facing a **Debian Buster**.

Once the OS and exposed services have been enumerated it's time to enumerate the web server.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/webpage.png)

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/wappalyzer.png)

It seems that the page it's not configurated at all. The links and buttons doesn't work and we can't see anything interesting in the source code of the page. However, both **Wappalyzer** and **WhatWeb** are indicating that PHP is being used server-side. 

Let's focus on fuzzing and PHP file enumeration. We'll brute-force the website to list directories and files. 

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/gobuster.png)

We find out some directories and PHP files. We see the classic **info.php** wich is generated by the PHP function **phpinfo()**. This file exposes all PHP configurations.

# Vulnerability Assesment
-----------

In **php.info** you can search any directives to abuse them.

- **disable_functions** - no disable functions, so we can use system, shell_exec, exec, to exeute commands.
- **file_uploads** - we can upload files.

In the following link you can find information about this abuse: https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/file-inclusion/lfi2rce-via-phpinfo.html

I'll focus on the LFI one. Firstly, we need a LFI vuln. I will use Burp Suite to send a POST request in order to force the upload of a PHP file. If I could find any way to force the server to interpretate my code (wich is a Reverse Shell) I could get into the server.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/burpsuite1.png)

**wfuzz** detected the parameter **filename**.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/wfuzz.png)

<br>
# Exploitation
-----

With the filename parameter we can see the content of /etc/passwd. However, we can't reach any files we upload through the POST request. 

Actually, the server is erasing the file at the moment we upload the file in question (it's a temporary resource: /tmp). So, we may have to consider a **Race-Condition**. To perform it, I'll download the following script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/master/File%20Inclusion/Files/phpinfolfi.py 

I'm going to change some important variables. The final script was:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# https://www.insomniasec.com/downloads/publications/LFI%20With%20PHPInfo%20Assistance.pdf
# The following line is not required but supposedly optimizes code.  
# However, this breaks on some Python 2 installations, where the future module version installed is > 0.16.  This can be a pain to revert.

Basically, it will try to upload a file and point it many times until the file's code is interpretated.

# Post-Exploitation
----------

```bash
# tty upgrading
❯ script /dev/null -c bash
❯ Ctrl+Z
❯ stty raw -echo; fg
❯ reset xterm
❯ export TERM=xterm
❯ export SHELL=bash
❯ stty rows 44 columns 185
```

If we run the command ``hostname -I`` we will notice that we are not in the real machine, we are in a **container**.

- We have no file /var/run/docker.sock, docker it's not installed.
- **capsh** it's not installed.
- No users directories in /home and no users with a shell (only root and we can't access it)
- No PHP files in /var/www/html with the string "**password**"
- No files in the hole container with the string "**config**"

To recon the container we will use the utility [**linPEAS**](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS). If we run linPEAS we'll see the section "Unexpected in root" with the file **.oldkeys.tgz** that contains a public SSH key and a private SSH key. In this point, we'll try to break the private SSH key.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/ssh2john.png)

**ssh2john** has converted the key into a hash. We'll try to crack the hash with john using the rockyou.txt dictionary. 

root's password is **choclate93**.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/flag1.png)

But remember, we need to scape the container.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/proc_net_arp.png)

In the directory /root/.ssh we see a public key file wich shows that the user admin can connect to 192.168.150.1, there's "trust" between them.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/public_key_admin.png)

We'll try to connect to 192.168.150.1 using the user admin and the same password as root.

We can! There's a passord reuse.

![](/assets/images/vh-infovore/flag2.png)

admin is in the docker group. In this case I can create a container that mounts all the filesystem (even the root directory) into my container filesystem so I can access all directories and files.
